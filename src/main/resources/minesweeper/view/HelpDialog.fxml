The objective of this game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. You start the game by clicking any cell, which is guaranteed to be safe. The number in a revealed cell indicates how many mines are in the adjacent cells. If you believe a cell contains a mine, right-click to flag it. Revealing a mine results in a loss, while successfully flagging all mines results in a win. The game interface includes a timer, showing the remaining time, and a mine counter, indicating the number of mines left to be flagged. The level indicator shows the current game level, and important messages are displayed to help guide your gameplay. In addition to standard moves, you have two superpowers to assist you. Superpower 1, when activated by clicking its icon, randomly flags 2 mine cells on the board. Superpower 2 freezes the game timer for 10 seconds, giving you extra time to plan your next moves without pressure. Use these powers strategically to gain an advantage. Flag cells you are certain contain mines to avoid clicking them accidentally later. Look for common patterns and use the number clues to identify safe cells. Always plan ahead and use your superpowers when you're stuck or need a quick advantage. TimeBOMB Sweep is a game of logic and strategy, so take your time to think about each move and use all available tools to clear the board safely. Good luck, and enjoy the game!" textAlignment="JUSTIFY" wrapText="true">
